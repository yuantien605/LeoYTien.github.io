I am a second-year master's student in the Department of Economics and Department of Political Science at Duke University. My interest covers a broad range of topics in Political Violence and Civil Wars.

My current research looks at a prominent form of violence neglected by political scientists in the past: scorched earth campaigns. In the paper, I explain the logic and variations of large-scale burning against civilians in civil wars.

I am applying to PhD programs in Political Science this year.
